HTML5 Drag and Drop Fileupload example with Rails 3 
===================================================

This is just a proove of concept app. It creates a rack endpoint:

 app/controllers/upload_endpoint.rb

which accepts the file uploads. The javascript makes use of the <code>FileReader</code> if available.
For Chrome and Safari a hidden <code><input type="file"></code> will be created.
